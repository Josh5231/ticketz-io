        Welcome to Ticketz.io, the modern watered down open source ticketing system for IT departments.
        We have set out to solve the problem of overcluttered, slow, outdated, non-user-friendly work order systems
        that are so common in the IT world today. It is designed to do exactly what most small-mid sized IT departments actually need,
        without all the extra features that get in the way.<br><br>
        Thanks for considering contributing! I'm excited for how far this project will go! Feel free to get creative!
        Please open issues, and contribute to anything that you can see needs improvement.<br><br>

        Here's our to do list --<br>

        <ul>
            <li>Registration page for organizations</li>
            <li>Refactor Ticket Submission page</li>
            <li>Refactor Login method</li>
            <li>Refactor/cleanup dashboard</li>
            <li>Add charts/reports to dashboard</li>
            <li>Gamify dashboard</li>
        </ul>
