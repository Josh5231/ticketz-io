In the client --> dashboard folder is the react app - the admin dashboard.

The client --> site folder contains the rest of the site which is currently just plain html/css/js.

If you would like to contribute, please take a look at the checklist on the homepage, or any outstanding issue.
If you see anything that needs improvement please feel free to open an issue :) You are more than welcome to
get creative as well -- restyle pages, and add new modules and features! Thanks!
